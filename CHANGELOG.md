# Changelog

## 0.27.0 (beta)

### Feature Changes

* Removed `Star Hunt` option and reworked Power Stars:
  * `Star Way Spirits Needed` and `Star Way Power Stars Needed` options now determine how many spirits and power stars are needed to open Star Way. Any combination is valid, like 7 spirits & 0 power stars, 0 spirits & 50 power stars, 4 spirits & 30 power stars etc.
* `Seed Goal` option
  * Select between "Defeat Bowser" and "Open Star Way"
  * "Open Star Way" is basically the old `Star Hunt Ends Game` setting, but can now be used while also requiring star spirits to open the teleporter.
* `Shuffle Star Beam` option
  * Turns the Star Beam into an item and shuffles it into another location
  * Picking up the Star Beam item unlocks the Star Beam ability in battle, but does not increase the star power gauge or unlock any other star power ability
  * The Star Beam cutscene in Star Haven instead offers a different item
  * Hallway Bowser gets dialogue hinting at the location of the Star Beam, if Mario reaches him without having found the Star Beam. This dialogue plays even during `Cutscene Mode: Minimal`
* `Star Beam Spirits Needed` and `Star Beam Power Stars Needed` options
  * Allows setting requirements for getting the item in the Star Beam item location in Star Haven
  * Can be combined with the new `Shuffle Star Beam` option
(Note: The `Require Specific Spirits` and `Limit Chapter Logic` options only affect opening Star Way, not acquiring the Star Beam)
* New sign posts on Shooting Star Summit and in Star Sanctuary will now spell out the requirements. If the unlock is free, that is it needs 0 Star Spirits and 0 Power Stars, the respective sign post will instead not spawn at all
* Reworked the pause menu Power Stars counter
  * This counter is hidden if there are no Power Stars placed in the seed
  * The icon in front of the "\<current> / \<max>" display now shows which unlock is coming up next:
  Either a Shooting Star icon for "Star Way", the Star Beam icon for "Star Beam", and if both of those are already unlocked, a Power Star icon
  * The max value in the "\<current> / \<max>" display now also refers to the unlock that's coming up next
  * Example: Mario needs 10 Power Stars to open Star Way, 20 to get the Star Beam, and 35 total are placed in the seed. Then the Power Star counter will show:
    * "[Shooting Star icon] \<current> / 10", if Mario has less than 10 Power Stars,
    * "[Star Beam icon] \<current> / 20", if Mario has 10 or more, but fewer than 20 Power Stars,
    * "[Power Star icon] \<current> / 35", if Mario has 20 or more Power Stars

### Logic changes

* While `Keyitems Outside Dungeon` (aka Keysanity) is turned off, the FP Plus chest in the Koopa Bros. Fortress area is no longer a valid location for Koopa Fortress Keys
* Now expects Watt for traversing the dark caves in Bowser's Castle
* Now expects having enough star spirits and power stars to both open Star Way and get the Star Beam, to get past chapter 8 Jr. Troopa and Hallway Bowser (only relevant in prep for entrance rando)

### Tricks & Glitches

* New options
  * "Volcano Sushie Glitch w/ Goombario save block storage"
  * "Chapter 7 bridge w/ SuperBoots"
  * "Prologue Repel Gel early" (Parakarry-only and Lakilester-only versions)
  * "Sewers Metal Block Room Super Block w/ clippy"
  * "Kooper Puzzle Skip"
  * "Ruins Stones Skip"
  * "Wattless chapter 4 dark room"
  * "Clippy Green Station Multicoin Block"
* Removed options
  * Flarakarry (Bombette) (due to it possibly causing a softlock)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug that could rarely cause unintended item prices for shop items in Dry Dry Outpost if `Randomize Puzzles` and `Include Shops` were turned on
* Lowered logical star piece requirements for some of Merlow's trades (the original calculations were off)
* Homeward Shroom now properly reloads the music if the munching SFX is skipped by unpausing manually
* Fix entrance rando issues with having Watt/Sushie/Lakilester active through certain loading zones
* Fix counting star spirits twice during same-seed multiplayer
* Fix Russ T. giving the toy box colored boxes code w/o having handed in the Dictionary first
* (console only) Fix vanilla freeze when trying to Tidal Wave during phase 2 of the Lava Piranha battle if there are Petit Piranhas alive
* Fix Kent C. Koopa breaking the coin cap when handing back the 50 coins when defeated after paying him
* Fix frozen camera during Kooper's Shell turn-in cutscene

### Miscellaneous

* Renamed some locations in the spoiler log for clarity

### Additional Technical Changelog

* Added ModFlag `1100` which gets set to True once the current seed goal is reached
* Split up chapter 8 progress byte into flags
* Adding the Star Beam item on item id `0x2DD` shifts up all item ids above that by one
* With the Star Beam item a new item type `STARPOWER` is added and referenced within the seed generator
* New DBKey `StarBeamArea`: Has to be set by the generator to the area id of the area the Star Beam gets shuffled to. This is referenced by Hallway Bowser's hint dialogue. If an invalid area id is provided, Bowser will state that the Star Beam can be found in Rogueport.
* Generator will throw a new `ItemPoolTooSmallError` if the settings make it remove more items from the trash item pool (to make place for Power Stars, Pouches etc.) than there are items in the trash item pool to begin with
* To have the generator pick a random number of Magical Seeds to open the Flower Gate, now set `MagicalSeedsRequired` to `-1` (was: set `MagicalSeedsRequired` to `5`)
